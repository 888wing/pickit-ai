- GitHub repository verified clean

## Current Security Posture

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Local Credentials** | ‚úÖ Secured | Stored in `~/.pickit-secure/` with restricted permissions |
| **Git Repository** | ‚úÖ Clean | No credentials in repo or history |
| **API Keys** | ‚úÖ Rotated | New keys generated, old keys revoked |
| **Environment Config** | ‚úÖ Configured | Using `.env` file with secure paths |
| **GitHub** | ‚úÖ Safe | Public repository contains no secrets |

## Verification Checklist

‚úÖ **No credentials in project directory**
```bash
ls LightroomAISelector/node-bridge/credentials.json
# Result: File not found ‚úì
```

‚úÖ **Credentials in secure location**
```bash
ls ~/.pickit-secure/credentials.json
# Result: File exists with 600 permissions ‚úì
```

‚úÖ **Git ignoring sensitive files**
```bash
git check-ignore LightroomAISelector/node-bridge/credentials.json
# Result: File is ignored ‚úì
```

‚úÖ **Environment variables configured**
```bash
cat LightroomAISelector/node-bridge/.env
# Result: Points to secure location ‚úì
```

## Development Setup for New Contributors

When others clone your repository, they need to:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/888wing/pickit-ai.git
   cd pickit-ai
   ```

2. **Set up their own Google Cloud credentials**
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create a service account
   - Download credentials JSON

3. **Configure credentials**
   ```bash
   # Copy example files
   cp LightroomAISelector/node-bridge/credentials.example.json credentials.json
   cp LightroomAISelector/node-bridge/.env.example .env
   
   # Edit with their credentials
   # Then run the security script
   ./secure-credentials.sh
   ```

## Best Practices Going Forward

### DO ‚úÖ
- Always use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials outside project directory
- Use `.env.example` files as templates
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Review service account permissions

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Never commit credentials to git
- Don't share API keys in documentation
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in source code
- Don't use production credentials in development

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Run monthly credential rotation
   - Check Google Cloud audit logs
   - Review repository for accidental commits

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit service account permissions
   - Use separate credentials for dev/prod
   - Enable 2FA on Google Cloud account

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Keep encrypted backup of credentials
   - Document credential recovery process
   - Maintain access logs

## Emergency Procedures

If credentials are compromised:

1. **Immediately revoke compromised keys** in Google Cloud Console
2. **Generate new credentials**
3. **Update all applications** using the credentials
4. **Review access logs** for unauthorized usage
5. **Notify affected users** if necessary
